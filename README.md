## Introduction

Welcome to the 25 + 5 Clock project! This is a web application that allows users to set and manage their work and break times using the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This project was built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification. It fulfils a set of user stories designed to test various aspects of the application, ensuring it meets functional requirements and usability standards.
